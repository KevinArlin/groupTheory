Files for AoPS Group Theory diagrams, organized by week. 
Files that are designed for interactive 3D compilation can be compiled either at asymphost.xyz or on your local machine.
Files that output animations can only be compiled on your local machine.
Many files will only compile with solids.asy sharing a folder/selected along with the main file at asymphost.
Some will only compile with animation2.asy as well, which is just a minor skin over the base library animation.
